Welcome to Fluffy's arch installer, made to reduce install time by as much as possible.
This script is designed to install a btfs arch install with grub as bootloader and zsh as main shell.

feel free to modify, redistribute and reuse. i am sorry for messy code in advance ðŸ’€

`bash <(curl -sL install.fluffcraft.dev)`
